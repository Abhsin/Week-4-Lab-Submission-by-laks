Flood Fill Function Flood-fill is a common algorithm used to fill connected regions of the board with a new value based on a specified condition. The code takes an input board, an old value, a new value, and coordinates (x, y) as arguments. It recursively updates the board by changing the old value to the new value for all connected cells.
